### 10/5/2025:
* I decided to learn how to install GoDot first
* I started by watching a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mf60ckpgO0)
* After the video tutorial, I started to download GoDot in the official website
  * I first press the download button and extracted the file
* I started to have trouble with incorporating the downloaded file in my IDE
* Next Step: Ask Mr. Mueller or anyone else that uses GoDot how to put GoDot in my IDE
